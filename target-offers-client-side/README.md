# Target Offers Client Side

## Overview

This sample demonstrates using Adobe Expreience Platform to get personalization offers from Target.  The web page changes based on the target offers returned.  

This sample uses the [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html) to get target offers and to render them. 

Here is what the page looks like before and after personalization content is rendered.
